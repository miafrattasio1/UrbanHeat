                        <strong>Joshua Bemis:</strong> Josh is an Aerospace Engineering BS/MS student from Haverhill,
                        MA. Going to his family’s lake house every summer, Josh has developed an appreciation for the
                        outdoors. Combining his technical skills learned at WPI with a passion for being outside, Josh
                        was excited for the opportunity to work on a multidisciplinary project. Josh looks forward to
                        collecting valuable data that could make an impact on environmental policy in Southern Spain.

                        <strong>Mia Frattasio:</strong> Mia is a Computer Science and Data Science student at WPI, with
                        a
                        concentration in Cybersecurity. Growing up on a river in Massachusetts and spending free time
                        kayaking sparked her love for the outdoors and a strong connection to the environment. She
                        is passionate about protecting the Earth and understanding the changes it's going through. This
                        project gave her the opportunity to combine her technical skills with something she cares about-
                        Urban Heat Islands.

                        Domingo, Dominican Republic. Growing up in Panama City, Panama while visiting family in the
                        countryside of Colombia every year led to his appreciation of the outdoors, noticing the
                        difference in air qualify and the peacefulness of nature in comparison to the city. Jorge is
                        interested in using his technical skills and engineering knowledge towards helping people around
                        the world. This project gave him the opportunity to do so in a continent and region different to
                        his own while learning as he worked on a team.
