# Street Heat: Urban Environmental Monitoring
This project was developed by 4 Worcester Polytechnic Institute students, working in Cadiz, Spain: Joshua Bemis, Mia Frattasio, William Gerlach, and Jorge Saa. They can be reached at gr-UrbanEnvC25@wpi.edu. This project was completed as a social science research project for WPI. 

Mia Frattasio (mia.frattasio@gmail.com) was the primary developer in this project, direct programming questions should go to her.

This project has 6 main pages: Data, About, Awareness, MyData, Login and Register

Data(Dashboard): This is where users can see data from any transect conducted by researchers around the world. Heatmaps are displayed, CSV files can be downloaded, and users can search by location. This main page uses the Heatmap and Post components and is connected to Firebase. 

About: This page, built with basic code, is a page where users can learn about the project, device, and how to recreate it. This is a central hub for researchers to learn more and create their own project, and upload data. 

Awareness: This is the main hub for citizens to learn more about Urban Heat Islands and why this project is important. 

MyData: This page is similar to the Data page, however it only shows data of the current logged-in user.

Login: This is the page a user can login. 

Register: This is a page where a user can register, via Google Firebase authentication.
